# Wind Catcher Simulation Report

## Introduction

This report documents the simulation of wind catchers using ANSYS Fluent. The goal was to study the airflow dynamics under varying wind conditions and determine the efficiency of different wind catcher configurations.

## Methodology

### Simulation Setup

The simulation was set up using the k-epsilon turbulence model with the following boundary conditions:
- Inlet velocity: 10 m/s
- Outlet pressure: 0 Pa
- Wall condition: No-slip

### Solver Settings

The solver was configured with a time step of 0.01 seconds and a maximum iteration count of 1000, with a convergence criterion of 1e-5.

## Results

### Velocity profile 

### Conclusion

The simulations indicate that wind catchers with the current design efficiently capture wind energy, as shown by the velocity distribution and pressure profiles.
